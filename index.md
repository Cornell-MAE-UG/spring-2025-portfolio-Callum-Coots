Hello!  My name is Callum Coots and I am a future mechanical engineer. I am currently majoring in Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University's Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. One of my greatest passions within the discipline is CAD; there is nothing like seeing my designs come to life on the computer screen. The unique blend of problem solving and creativity required for 3D modeling is what I strive for. Additionally, I am very passionate about sustainability. I believe in achieving all of my engineering dreams while keeping energy consumption low and protecting our planet.  When I'm not prototyping or CAD-ing, you can find me on a 16 mile run, or skiing in my hometown of Missoula, Montana.
