This project was for a CAD design assignment in one of my classes. The assignment was to CAD one of my belongings with a mimimum of four bodies. For this project, I modeled my Garmin Forerunner 745 running watch in CAD with exact dimensions gathered using a digital caliper.  I went significantly above the expectations of the assignment, modeling a total of 30 bodies, and landing my submission on the course's "CAD wall of fame." This project showcases my CAD skills, especially related to product development.

A reference image of my watch is shown here along with a technical sketch (my first step):

![WATCH reference]({{ "/assets/images/WATCH-asset-2.png" | relative_url }}){: .inline-image-l}{:height="200px" width="300px"} ![WATCH drawing]({{ "/assets/images/WATCH-asset-1.png" | relative_url }}){: .inline-image-l}{:height="200px" width="675px"}

The CAD model is shown here:

Finally, here are some renderings of the watch:
