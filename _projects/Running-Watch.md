This project was for a CAD design assignment in one of my classes. The assignment was to CAD one of my belongings with a mimimum of four bodies. For this project, I modeled my running watch in CAD with exact dimensions gathered using a digital caliper.  I went significantly above the expectations of the assignment, modeling a total of 30 bodies, and landing my submission on the course's "CAD wall of fame." This project showcases my CAD skills, especially related to product development.


CAD models of each custom part and prototype are shown below:
