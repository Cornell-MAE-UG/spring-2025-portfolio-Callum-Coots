This is a personal project that I took on in order to learn Revit and explore sustainable design, not affiliated with any of my classes. For this project, I custom designed a single family home in Autodesk Revit that adheres to Passive House principles. Passive House is a set of guidelines that relates to sustainable building design. Passive House buildings are simple, but effective, with the main goal of reducing energy consumption and operational costs. The house that I designed features the largest glazed area on the south-wall with a large roof overhang, allowing low-angle winter sunlight to warm the house while keeping out the high-angle summer sun. Windows are triple-paned, to maximize insulation, and the east- and west-facing windows are covered by vertical fins to limit sun exposure. The house is a simple shape to minimize surface area while maximizing volume. There is an entry vestibule to maintain airtightness. Finally, buffer rooms (non-living spaces) are placed on the north side of the house, where it is colder in the winter. This project showcases my skills in MEP engineering, building design, and BIM CAD.

A reference image of my watch is shown here along with a technical sketch (my first step):
