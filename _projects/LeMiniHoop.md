LeMiniHoop is a mini basketball return system designed by me and four of my colleagues to shoot a mini basketball back at the user after they make a shot on their mini hoop. Production of LeMiniHoop involved custom parts manufacturing, budgeting, use of Autodesk Fusion, 3D printing, laser cutting, and electronic integration including arduino. We developed two prototypes, with the second prototype achieving 5000 RPMs on the flywheels, able to shoot a mini basketball approximately 15 feet when hung from a typical door. LeMiniHoop runs off a 12V power supply that plugs into a Type A or Type B outlet.  The speed of the flywheels can be manually controlled using a dial on the exterior of the prototype.

CAD models of each custom part and prototype are shown below:
