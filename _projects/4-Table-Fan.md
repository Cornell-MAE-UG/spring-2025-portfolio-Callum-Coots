This project was for a technical sketching assignment in one of my courses. The goal was to dissassemble one of my belongings and sketch each component. The chosen item needed to have at least one moving part and at least 4 total parts. For this project, I disassembled and reassembled a table fan, making drawings of every component along the way. In the end, I sketched 18 parts, many of which had lots of mechanical complexity. This project showcases my technical drawing skills, involving design communication, component labeling, and exploded views.

The CAD model of my house design is shown here:
